TODO LIST:
- Actual parkour:
    X Hitting start/end points
    X Hitting checkpoints
        X Warn users that they hit a checkpoint without starting the course.
    X Restart course command
    X Back to last checkpoint command
    X Add cooldown on point messages
        X Make this location based. (Not location based but checkpoint based)

- Parkour misc:
    - UI to edit the parkour course
        X Delete checkpoints
        X Put coords and world info on point lore
        X Fix error when trying to edit a course with no points.
        - Add option to remove the course?
    - Allow sign placements to execute parkour commands
    X Reload the parkour course pressure plates and armor stands when during onEnable() (not easily doable becauase armor stands spawn with different ids.. We could probably update them tho.. Maybe later)
    X Make pressure plates unbreakable (probably block break event and check if it's our stored block location)
    X Prevent the block from under the plates from breaking.
    X Prevent floating pressure plates from breaking or allowing them to be placed.
    X Colored armor stand names
    X Instead of adding checkpoints by having the user enter 1,2,3, etc.. Auto increment them
        X Whe a point is removed we need to reset the number of all of the checkpoints > than the deleted one
    X Enable/disable parkour module in the main plugin config.
    X Colored parkour messages back to the user
    - Parkour command help text
    X Add a second armor stand:
        X "Parkour"
        X "Checkpoint #1"
    - Permissions
