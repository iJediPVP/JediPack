TODO LIST:
- Actual parkour:
    - Hitting start/end points
    - Hitting checkpoints
        - Warn users that they hit a checkpoint without starting the course.
    - Restart course command
    - Back to last checkpoint command

- Parkour misc:
    - UI to edit the parkour course
        - Delete course, Delete checkpoints
    - Allow sign placements to execute parkour commands
    - Reload the parkour course pressure plates and armor stands when during onEnable()
    X Make pressure plates unbreakable (probably block break event and check if it's our stored block location)
    X Prevent the block from under the plates from breaking.
    X Prevent floating pressure plates from breaking or allowing them to be placed.
    X Colored armor stand names
    X Instead of adding checkpoints by having the user enter 1,2,3, etc.. Auto increment them
        X Whe a point is removed we need to reset the number of all of the checkpoints > than the deleted one
    X Enable/disable parkour module in the main plugin config.
    X Colored parkour messages back to the user
    - Parkour command help text
    X Add a second armor stand:
        X "Parkour"
        X "Checkpoint #1"
